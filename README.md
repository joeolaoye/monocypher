# MonoCypher
A mono-alphabetic cypher originally written in Java by the guys at http://www.sanfoundry.com/java-program-implement-monoalphabetic-cypher/ shamelessly stolen and extended by just one line for my use and by extion the use of everybody who stumbles on this. 
If you can write this same cypher in your language of choice, please do so and open a pull request, some other shameless copier of code will find it useful.
That's all and thank you for reading.
